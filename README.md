Modular GUI using PySide and Yapsy

## Summary

The idea of the Modular GUI is to encourage small modules that can be connected with each other. That means that you can focus on get a small feature just right and then plug it into a bigger sistem.

All the nuances on how different elements of the interface fall together in the same space are managed for you so you can focus on the task at hand.

Finally, versioning of modules means that you can always go back if something goes wrong.
